# Right Triangle Solver App

A Python application that calculates the hypotenuse and area of a right triangle based on the lengths of its two legs. The calculator uses the Pythagorean theorem and provides results rounded to 3 decimal places.

## Features
- Accepts decimal inputs for triangle leg lengths
- Calculates hypotenuse using Pythagorean theorem
- Calculates triangle area
- Rounds all results to 3 decimal places
- Input validation for numeric values

## How to Use
1. Run the program
2. Enter the length of the first leg
3. Enter the length of the second leg
4. View the calculated hypotenuse and area

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the Right Triangle Solver App
What is the first leg of the triangle: 20
What is the second leg of the triangle: 40.5
For a triangle with legs of 20 and 40.5 the hypotenuse is 45.169.
For a triangle with legs of 20 and 40.5 the area is 405.0.
